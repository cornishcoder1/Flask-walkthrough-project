        On April 26, 2941, Gandalf and the Dwarves arrived at Bag End. After a big tea and supper with Bilbo, they
        explained themselves and their intentions. Bilbo was at first reluctant to join the group but Gandalf rushed him
        out of the door.

            <h3>Thoren Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
                Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
                youth, he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA
                2770. While in exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he
                participated in the Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath
                the East-gate of Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch
                found on the ground as a shield, he gained the epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even
                in death.[2]

                Thorin became King-in-Exile of Durin's Folk in TA 2850 after his father went missing, and died in the
                dungeons of Dol Guldur.

            <h3>Fili and Kili</h3>
			<p>
				Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also nephews of
				Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing feature was his long nose,
				the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
			<p>
				Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was Fundin, the
				father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of
				Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company on the quest to reclaim the
				Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to
				reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company
				as they were the most skilled out of the others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later
				settled in the Lonely Mountain with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

			<p>
				Glóin son of Gróin was one of the Dwarves of Thorin II Oakenshield's company who set out to reclaim the Lonely
				Mountain in the Quest of Erebor. He was also the father of Gimli, who became a member of the Fellowship of the Ring.

				Glóin chiefly appears in The Hobbit as a supporting character. Glóin also appears in The Fellowship of the Ring
				during the Council of Elrond.
